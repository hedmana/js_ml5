# Machine learning with ml5.js
I created this repository for me to try out different machine learning methods using the ml5.js library:

## Neural Network
Under the neural_network folder you'll find a simple web app that visualizes the training process of a neural network. The program includes three stages: data collection, model training, and predictions.

### Data Collection
During the data collection stage, the user is able to place different characters within a square. Characters are placed by clicking the desired character on the keyboard and the placing it with a mouse click. Make sure to place at least to types of characters before training the model.

### Model Training
When the user is happy with the placed characters, the model is trained by pressing ENTER.

### Predictions
After the training is done, the user can now click the square to plot predictions generated by the model.
