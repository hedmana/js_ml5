# Machine learning with ml5.js
Trying out the ml5.js library (https://ml5js.org/). 

## Animal Classification
A convolutional Neural Network for image classification. Here's a list of the model has been trained to recognize: https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/main/src/utils/IMAGENET_CLASSES.js.

## Neural Network
Neural network that is trained on user input to classify points on a plane.

### Data Collection
Place characters within the square. Characters are placed by clicking the desired character on the keyboard and the placing it with a mouse click. Make sure to place at least two types of characters before training the model.
