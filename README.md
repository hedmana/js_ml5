# Machine learning with ml5.js
I created this repository for me to try out different machine learning methods using the ml5.js library (https://ml5js.org/). To test out the different models, just open the corresponding "index.html" file in a local browser.

## Animal Classification
The image_classification directory contains a simple web app based on the pre-trained MobileNet image classification model. Here's a list of the model has been trained to recognize: https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/main/src/utils/IMAGENET_CLASSES.js. To test the model, wait for the MobileNet model to load, and drop an image (JPG) in the box.

## Neural Network
Under the neural_network directory you'll find a simple neural network that is trained on user input to classify points on a plane. The application includes three stages: data collection, model training, and predictions.

### Data Collection
During the data collection stage, the user is able to place different characters within a square. Characters are placed by clicking the desired character on the keyboard and the placing it with a mouse click. Make sure to place at least to types of characters before training the model.

### Model Training
When the user is happy with the placed characters, the model is trained by pressing ENTER.

### Predictions
After the training is done, the user can now click the square to plot predictions generated by the model.
